<p align="center">A Balatro mod that makes the game a little bit easier.</p>

<p align="center">Balatro is a challenging game, so this hopes to make it a bit easier without ruining all the magic of the game. When enabled, the first two rerolls of every shop will be free.</p>

## Installation

 - Install the mod loader [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) if you haven't already. 
 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DivvyCr/Balatro-Preview/releases/latest).
 - Copy the downloaded folder to `C:\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\`

## Notes

 - This is a "cheat" mod first and foremost, but ideally is made not to completely sap the fun out of your runs.
 - With that being said, this mod makes Flash Card even stronger than it already is.
 - This should also stack with the joker `Chaos the Clown` to make three rerolls.
